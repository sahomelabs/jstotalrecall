// Variables & Datatypes



// B. Strings // 
For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the following instructions.

Create a variable called firstVariable
Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
Change the value of this variable to some number
Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
What is the value of firstVariable?
Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean


// C. Booleans // 
Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements print truein the console. Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things that don't make sense but happen to print trueto the console

// D. Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else
Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow
Change your code so that if the variable animalis anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."

E. Driver's Ed
Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic
Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!", if the age is 16 years or older, or, if the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."


II. Loops
Remember: USE letwhen you initialize your for loops!

This is GOOD: for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++)

This is NO GOOD: for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)

A. The basics
Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive
Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400
Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000


B. Get even
Print out the numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100
Adjust your code to add a message next to even numbers only that says: "<-- is an even number"


C. Give me Five
For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a number. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five
Example Output:

Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 10 to a variable called bank_account.
Check your work! Your bank_account should have $55 in it.

You got a bonus! Your pay is now doubled each week. Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 100 multiplied by 2.
Check your work! Your bank_account should have $10,100 in it.
